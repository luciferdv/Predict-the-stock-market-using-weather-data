Setup
For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

pandas for managing the data.
numpy for mathematical operations.
scipy for scientific and statistical computing capabilities.
sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
statsmodels for performing statistical analysis, including regression.
seaborn for visualizing the data.
matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
tqdm for providing progress bars to Python loops.
