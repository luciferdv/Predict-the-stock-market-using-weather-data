# Predict-the-stock-market-using-weather-data
Task
Forecast the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJI) using lagged prices and weather data from New York City.

Background
A potential driving factor of stock prices is the current weather in New York City, a global financial hub and the physical location of the stock exchange where constituent stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJI) are traded. You hypothesize that the mood of traders and investors in New York City is influenced by weather conditions, impacting trade patterns and consequently, stock prices. Your theory suggests potential correlations, such as traders being more inclined to buy during favorable weather and sell during gloomy conditions. To validate this hypothesis, you aim to test if New York's weather patterns account for some of the variation in stock prices. Additionally, you aim to explore whether these weather patterns could be used to enhance the predictive power of forecasting models.

You understand that the stock market reflects the decisions of millions of investors responding to vast amounts of information, of which the weather in New York City is just one example. You understand that the stock market is inherently very difficult to predict, and you will be satisfied with any result that shows a causal or predictive link between weather patterns and stock prices.
